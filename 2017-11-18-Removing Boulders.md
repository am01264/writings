# Boulder Removal

## About Me

I believe that every person starts life a fundamentally well and decent human being. 

My job is to keep what's fundamentally good about you, help you get rid of psychological clutter, de-fuse those emotional land mines and allow you to express yourself in the healthiest way possible.

## What Can I Do For You?

> There was once a hiker, in a valley far away, who set out one morning to reach the peak of a mountain. With rich sunlight across the view, she could see exactly where she wanted to be. 
> 
> But no further than a few miles in, problems began. Great boulders of rock blocked her way, forcing her to grit her teeth, climb and fight forward.
> 
> She fought gallantly, but not a third of the way up, she was exhausted.

Life can be like this at times. We try hard to get what we want, but somehow, we sense something is blocking us.

This is where I come in. My job is to transform those boulders into those shiny little pebbles you'd happily show in your garden. 

Using a unique blend of tried and tested techniques, I can help you unwrap those boulders... and with the impressive power of the human brain, you can watch your boulders become pebbles.

At which point, it's up to you what you do with them (gardening optional).
