# Ethos
What I Stand For: A Moral Code of Action by [Andrew McAuley](http://andrewmcauley.co.uk/)


## Wisdom

I am wrong, and I am wrong often. I accept I have no monopoly on wisdom, but strive to see the world more clearly each day.

I strive to find the darkness of my blind-spots and open the curtains on them.


## Privacy 

You can let me know all your problems, and ask for advice, but they won't go outside my most trusted circle.

I will only consider sharing it when:
 - You openly share it with others and
 - I feel it appropriate


## Choice

I will not demand; I will ask, and you can always say no.

But not when:
 - There is insufficient time to explain
 - Harm would be caused
 - We have a Consensual-Non-Consent agreement
 - In sex, I make (refusable) demands


## Fairness

I will hold others to standards I have made clear.


## Helping others

When I listen deeply to another, have a sense for the deeper context and who that person is... I will then help.

Roughly:
 - Do no harm
 - In a way that fits them
 - To relieve their ailment (in mind or body)

But not:
 - Helping others with minor stress
 - Where I would hinder their growth
 - Providing "free" advice
