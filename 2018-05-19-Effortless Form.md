description: ...or how I write

When you can forget about structure, form can take on a completely different meaning.

As I'm writing this, I have a curious question in my mind. Am I writing...
 - An outline?
 - A summary?
 - An essay?
 - A book?

The truth is, I don't know. The project size doesn't matter. It could be any and all until I consider the content matured enough to share it. 

Over time it might even grow... from a blog post to a booklet, and then maybe a series of books.

But what is my process *really*?

 1. I start with an idea, I put it on a card.
    I throw many ideas on the wall.

 2. I order the cards into a storyline with a common theme throughout
    I throw out unecessary cards and add a few new ones to fill gaps.

 3. Next, I delve into each idea.
    I flesh out the points I want to cover.

This is how my writing flows, and I continue until I feel it has the required depth and quality. Then I just compile it into the output I want.

Now, if this makes you reach for the stationary, stop. I actually did this all digitally, using a writing app called "Gingko". It's unique. I recommend it.

Why don't you give it a try? 

It might even make writing easy.
