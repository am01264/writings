How can I retell my life's story? Exploring changes of perspective in my own life

Where has current thinking majorly diverted from past thought?

## Dishonesty

I used to believe that "using words to obtain an affect in another" was sufficient reason to say anything without further regard.

In this I have a new view, my words have power. Admittedly that power is limited, but I am responsible for what I say and the chances of extreme reactions. Knowing this, I have an ethical responsibility to weigh what I say.

## Dishonesty
I viewed myself too harshly believing I had been shameful person. While I had acted in a way I no longer wish to, I believe if I had the perspective I have today, I would not have chosen to lie.

Rather it was a comfort blanket that helped me feel in control in what felt like a very controlled world. Add in the lack of social experiences outside Teacher & Parent and I can see how I ended up in that trap.

I was not a bad person, but I was certainly not living up to my current standard of perspective. This is key.

## That people are fundamentally good

It took me quite a while to consider another view of this, but when I did I shed many toxic expectations of others.

While believing in others is healthy, assuming good in manipulators plays to their hand.

## Positive Thinking is Healthy
What a mind-fuck: positive thinking is not required. Optimism maybe, confidence sometimes... but always thinking positively? Some of the greatest artists of the world were tortured souls... and we say we must "think positively" to become "successful". My mind boggles at the thought.

Ironically it seems like a wonderful way to get the masses deluding themselves into comfortable thoughts.

## That I "Need" To Meet Other Peoples Expectations

The only "need" that I have is my own. Other peoples expectations may be an expression of their needs, but it has no reflection on me as a person.

These are your physical needs:

...and then your emotional needs:
> {INSERT EMOTIONAL NEEDS}

If I fuck up, it's okay to be straight forward in saying it. There's no need to hide.

## Assumptions
> Never assume,
> it makes an _ass_ of _u_, and _me_ 

A cheesy line to feel rebellious towards, but fantastic in meaning. It prompts you to question your assumptions and re-evaluate your decisions.

For example, clear communication requires you to put on another persons hat to find what they truly need to know... and then still, you could be wrong.

## The Little Things Are The Big Things
Oh how I hated this saying, but still I didn't take heed of it's power over time. 

I used to read this as saying I needed to pay attention to every detail all the time. I was wrong, it calls you to pay attention to the seemly insignificant, small actions, that snowball over time. This might be:
 - 5-minutes of exercise each day. 
 - Refusing to store snacks in your house.

I used to believe big things would blow me into a new life. No, minor things repeated become major things. If I wish to have a new life, start at the beginning, not the end.

Failure to apply finances well, results in piles of debt and no growth.

Spend the same time with a simple saving discipline, and you will have piles of cash, and opportunity.

So it is with exercise, social life and everything else.

Linking back to emotional needs, if you don't look them, you will become less emotionally stable over time.

## Self-Confidence Is Key!
Oh how I fell for this one. Hook, Line and what a Stinker! 

Apparently I wanted to become a sociopath, someone without empathy or understanding for anyone other than themselves.

Apparently I wanted to be someone who screams fuck the world! And plow right on through.

Funnily enough, I don't need over-confidence, or even under-confidence. For that matter, I don't need confidence.

What I do need though:
 - Clear direction
 - Self-compassion for when things go wrong. 
 - Enough humility to accept I get more wrong than right.
 - The skill of listening
 - Steadfast persistence

In what ways have I realised the benefits (be it skill, awareness, capabilities, or other) of past incidents I judged myself without due compassion at the time.

In what ways have I exceeded my unspoken expectations of myself?

Where have I been surprised by sudden shifts in thinking or perspective and proven myself ignorant?
