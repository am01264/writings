title: Testimonial for Gingko
description: After years of head-banging frustration with writing of any length, I've found a way to enjoy writing. 
---

At first I thought $4.99/month seemed too expensive for a notepad app.

What I found though, completely transformed the way I write, and the way I look at writing. Previously writing at any length was painful, headache inducing and just a frustrating experience of "What do I say" and "I know my stuff, why is this so difficult to put onto paper!?". I can't quite believe myself saying this, but I'm actually starting to enjoy writing.

Being able to get a sense of the whole text at a glance, while you're writing a specific part allows me to write with all of the context. I no longer need to ask "What did I say there?", it's in front of me, or a few key-presses away.

Other benefits include:

 - Starting with the seed of an outline, and then fleshing it out from there is the most effortless way of writing I have ever encountered. This app takes this idea and makes it 3-4 times easier still.

 - Simple navigation allows me to jump and dive across the text as fast as the ideas flow.

 - No longer feeling scared by an empty page. I'm actually excited to get started because it's so easy.

I would recommend the Gingko app wholeheartedly to anyone who is intimidated when writing large documents, as it's completely changed my experience of writing from painful to enjoyable.

To finish off - a huge thank you to the creators of Gingko. I can now use a computer to write! I highly recommend you check it out at [gingkoapp.com](https://gingkoapp.com/?ref=346849eb).

(Previously I used a mixture of Word, Evernote, index cards and a whole empty floor, now I use Gingko for writing & Evernote for research)
