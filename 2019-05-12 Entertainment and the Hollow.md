# Entertainment and the Hollow

Modern titans of the entertainment industry are finally finding out what the human mind desires. They seek neuropsychology, identifying and testing each instinctive response layer by layer deep down into the brain stem.

A part of me feels I should applaud them... But this is not the time to applaud. They meet the standard of "what draws people in", heck the even meet the standard of lighting the emotions... but that's it.

Modern entertainment, with its smooth storylines, each chapter dragging you on to the next, each camera giving a taste of what an interaction is... and letting you fill the blanks... has blanked too much.

The narrow focus on entertainment that draws viewers, hooks viewers and has them hanging on to the bitter end: It's interesting at first, energising maybe, and I can't lie, it has an appeal. But an appeal is all it is.

Never before have so many titans fought over our collective attention, and in a way... they gotten good. Stupid too.

You see, while they've been racing to the bottom of that brain stem - hooking Facebook into that emotion of Boredom, anchoring that Netflix sound with that feeling of "what's next" - they've missed the obvious.

What is the obvious, you might ask? The obvious is our cultural heritage... specifically the stories passed down through the generations. Rich tapestries of meaning flow deep in these stories covered by the otherwordly imagination of the listener. Each story may mean many things to many people... but you hear what you need.

By that standard, modern entertainment is a hollow husk of a seed in the face of deeply rooted trees so old you hardly notice them.

There are only three movies and one TV Series I would say had great meaning to me, and each of those was appropriate for a time and a place. None of them were huge hollywood-HD slick jobs, they were each odd-balls... and right now I don't want to see any of them, as it isn't the time, or the place.

But I digress. I want to tell a story, the story of an ugly duckling. But you already know it... your cup is full.

What if were to tell you a 6-year old understands that story, but most adults do not... Mythology can be truer than the world we live in.

In the case of the duck, it is not about a duck... it is about you, the listener, hearing a story you can relate to about being rejected by the group, and desparately wanting to fit in... and rediscovering your identity as a beautiful swan.

The level of hope such a small tale can engender through the conduit of the imagination is limitless. If I were to reduce it to a numerical measure, I would give it solid a 8/10 for giving hope.

Your average holywood tale of romance though, I would safely rate 0/10. Why? Well if you're well romantically, you already feel good... it's the little cherry on top. But if you're sufferingly romantically, how could you possibly relate to the impossible standards of those? If you are well, it could be 2/10... but when suffering, I'm tempted to rate it -2/10 as it could actively degrade hope.

They say hope is a healing balm for soul. By that measure, Holywood is sick.

...but I may have gotten too focused myself, down the rabbit hole of a conversation that needs an end. To that I warn, hope is not all there is. To construct entertainment against our animalistic drives may give profit, but at the loss of humanity, the loss of time and attention of its viewers.

We need higher standards. If you're wanting to explore some cultural heritage, and rich stories of old, I recommend the book "World Tales" by Idries Shah

Be well
