Hi there

[//]: # "Who am I & Why do I have this website?"

I'm Andrew. People have called me many things over the years, but my friends tell me I'm a deep thinker, a creative and source of generally good advice.



I'm very conscious of my privacy online, so I've opted out of all the social networks, but that left me with a problem. Some things I want to share with my friends, but I also don't want to pester friends with "look what I did" text messages or phone calls and even when I do share them, how do I go back to it later? It just seems a lot of hassle, so I created this site and filled it with things worthy of sharing.


[//]: "What immediate benefits can I give you?"

Right now, there isn't much on the site but I do have two recommendations for you:

1. If you want a laugh, you might like the [thank you letter] I recently wrote to my local hospital.

2. If you write on a regular basis, you might be intrigued by my [testimonial on Gingko], an app that completely transformed writing from a pain to a pleasure for me.

[thank you letter]: /hospital-letter
[testimonial on Gingko]: /gingko-testimonial

[//]: # "How Can I Keep Updated With Your Work?"



If you want to keep updated with future posts, I'm sorry but I don't have a method right now.

If you have a GitHub account however, you can probably follow any changes to the [site's code & content](https://github.com/am01264/am01264.github.io)
